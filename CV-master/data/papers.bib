The SEM fitted comprises the following links between traits: WBSF → LMA, WBSF → HCW, HCW → LMA, BF → HCW, and BF → MB, where the arrows indicate the causal direction between traits, with structural coefficients posterior means (posterior standard deviation) equal to −0.29 cm2/kg (0.09), 0.43 kg/kg (0.29), 0.10 cm2/kg (0.006), 1.92 kg/mm (0.28), and 0.03 score-grade/mm (0.006), respectively. The final SEM revealed some important putative causal relationships among the traits studied here. The implied causal effects suggest that interventions on meat tenderness and fat content would affect overall growth and muscle deposition. Knowledge regarding potential causal relationships inferred among the traits studied here can have important implications for the genetic selection and management of Nellore cattle for improvement of carcass and meat quality.}

ABSTRACT={This study focused on assessing the usefulness of using audio signal processing in the gaited horse industry. A total of 196 short-time audio files (4 s) were collected from video recordings of Brazilian gaited horses. These files were converted into waveform signals (196 samples by 80,000 columns) and divided into training (N = 164) and validation (N = 32) datasets. Twelve single-valued audio features were initially extracted to summarize the training data according to the gait patterns (Marcha Batida—MB and Marcha Picada—MP). After preliminary analyses, high-dimensional arrays of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Onset Strength (OS), and Tempogram (TEMP) were extracted and used as input information in the classification algorithms. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the 12 single-valued features set and each audio-feature dataset—AFD (MFCC, OS, and TEMP) for prior data visualization. Machine learning (random forest, RF; support vector machine, SVM) and deep learning (multilayer perceptron neural networks, MLP; convolution neural networks, CNN) algorithms were used to classify the gait types. A five-fold cross-validation scheme with 10 repetitions was employed for assessing the models' predictive performance. The classification performance across models and AFD was also validated with independent observations. The models and AFD were compared based on the classification accuracy (ACC), specificity (SPEC), sensitivity (SEN), and area under the curve (AUC). In the logistic regression analysis, five out of the 12 audio features extracted were significant (p < 0.05) between the gait types. ACC averages ranged from 0.806 to 0.932 for MFCC, from 0.758 to 0.948 for OS and, from 0.936 to 0.968 for TEMP. Overall, the TEMP dataset provided the best classification accuracies for all models. The most suitable method for audio-based horse gait pattern classification was CNN. Both cross and independent validation schemes confirmed that high values of ACC, SPEC, SEN, and AUC are expected for yet-to-be-observed labels, except for MFCC-based models, in which clear overfitting was observed. Using audio-generated data for describing gait phenotypes in Brazilian horses is a promising approach, as the two gait patterns were correctly distinguished. The highest classification performance was achieved by combining CNN and the rhythmic-descriptive AFD.}

abstract = {Summary This study aimed to assess the predictive ability of different machine learning (ML) methods for genomic prediction of reproductive traits in Nellore cattle. The studied traits were age at first calving (AFC), scrotal circumference (SC), early pregnancy (EP) and stayability (STAY). The numbers of genotyped animals and SNP markers available were 2342 and 321 419 (AFC), 4671 and 309 486 (SC), 2681 and 319 619 (STAY) and 3356 and 319 108 (EP). Predictive ability of support vector regression (SVR), Bayesian regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) and random forest (RF) were compared with results obtained using parametric models (genomic best linear unbiased predictor, GBLUP, and Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, BLASSO). A 5-fold cross-validation strategy was performed and the average prediction accuracy (ACC) and mean squared errors (MSE) were computed. The ACC was defined as the linear correlation between predicted and observed breeding values for categorical traits (EP and STAY) and as the correlation between predicted and observed adjusted phenotypes divided by the square root of the estimated heritability for continuous traits (AFC and SC). The average ACC varied from low to moderate depending on the trait and model under consideration, ranging between 0.56 and 0.63 (AFC), 0.27 and 0.36 (SC), 0.57 and 0.67 (EP), and 0.52 and 0.62 (STAY). SVR provided slightly better accuracies than the parametric models for all traits, increasing the prediction accuracy for AFC to around 6.3 and 4.8\% compared with GBLUP and BLASSO respectively. Likewise, there was an increase of 8.3\% for SC, 4.5\% for EP and 4.8\% for STAY, comparing SVR with both GBLUP and BLASSO. In contrast, the RF and BRANN did not present competitive predictive ability compared with the parametric models. The results indicate that SVR is a suitable method for genome-enabled prediction of reproductive traits in Nellore cattle. Further, the optimal kernel bandwidth parameter in the SVR model was trait-dependent, thus, a fine-tuning for this hyper-parameter in the training phase is crucial.},

Simulated genome comprised 50k SNP and 300 QTL, both biallelic and randomly distributed across 29 autosomes. A total of six traits were simulated considering different values for the narrow and broad-sense heritability. In the purely additive scenario with low heritability (h2 = 0.10), the predictive ability obtained using GBLUP was slightly higher than the other methods whereas ANN provided the highest accuracies for scenarios with moderate heritability (h2 = 0.30). The accuracies of dominance deviations predictions varied from 0.180 to 0.350 in GBLUP extended for dominance effects (GBLUP-D), from 0.06 to 0.185 in RF and they were null using the ANN and SVM methods. Although RF has presented higher accuracies for total genetic effect predictions, the mean-squared error values in such a model were worse than those observed for GBLUP-D in scenarios with large additive and dominance variances. When applied to prescreen important regions, the RF approach detected QTL with high additive and/or dominance effects. Among machine learning methods, only the RF was capable to cover implicitly dominance effects without increasing the number of covariates in the model, resulting in higher accuracies for the total genetic and phenotypic values as the dominance ratio increases. Nevertheless, whether the interest is to infer directly on dominance effects, GBLUP-D could be a more suitable method.}",

Bayesian networks were also investigated as an alternative method for feature selection. Phenotypes from 74 nondescript breed lambs were measured. A leave-one-out cross-validation strategy was performed and predictive ability statistics (R2, RMSE) were assessed. Moderate to high prediction accuracies were observed, with R2 values across models ranging, from 0.36 to 0.88 for carcass traits and 0.65 to 0.84 for meat cuts predictions. Results suggest that support vector machine algorithm is a potential alternative to the traditional multiple linear regression model. Further, the results of this study suggest that both stepwise and Bayesian network procedures could be useful as pre-selection tools of the input variables in non-parametric approaches and the best method for feature selection may be trait and model dependent.}

The breeds analyzed are distributed in two regions of Brazil (Southeast and Northeast). The Alpine, Saanen and Toggenburg (raised in Southeast) breeds were compared among themselves and with the breeds of Northeast (Anglo Nubian and Saanen). This study demonstrated that milk yield, 305-day lactation yield, lactation length and daily milk yield were influenced by the genetic of animal (breed) and the environmental conditions, such as flock, month and year of production. These same effects affected the milk composition and SCC which also were influenced by physiological stages of the does (lactation and test-day milk order). There were differences in milk composition between the breeds. This may be a result of diet and chemical composition of the pasture feeding the animals, as well as others genetic and environmental factors. The global averages for proportion of lactose were below of the minimum limits established by the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply. The average of SCC was above one million of cells/mL. This study is the first work of characterization of exotic breeds in tropical climate with a database derived of official milk recording.}
