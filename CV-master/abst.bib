    abstract = "{Feed efficiency traits are important for reducing feeding costs while potentially decreasing the environmental impact of broiler production. This study aimed to compare the predictive ability of different genome-wide prediction models for residual feed intake (RFI) calculated with linear and non-linear regression techniques. We also evaluated the heritability of such RFI as well as their associations with body weight. Genotypes and phenotypes used in this study were recorded from 32,747 purebred broiler chickens of both sexes. The individual feed intake was monitored daily in floor-raised birds using a radio-frequency antenna system. RFI was computed as the residual term of total feed intake (FI) adjusted for the average metabolic weight (AMW), body weight gain (BWG), and sex. The following regression methods were used to compute RFI: multiple linear regression (MLR), generalized additive model using splines (GAM), support vector regression using a radial basis kernel (SVR), and two-hidden layer neural network (NN). The different RFI assessments were fitted jointly with body weight measured at the end of the feeding trial (FBW) using a two-trait mixed model. The effects of contemporary groups were fitted as fixed for both traits, whereas sex was also considered for FBW. RFI (computed with different regression techniques) was predicted using different genomic prediction models (BayesA, BayesB, BayesCπ, GBLUP, RKHS, and SVR). Genomic prediction accuracy (ACC) was assessed using a random forward validation scheme, in which data from previous generations were used for training the models while later generations were used to test predictions. The effect of the RFI computation method on ACC was tested using an unpaired Wilcoxon test. Sample variance observed for RFI ranged between 57,207.04 and 59,254.76, depending on the regression method used to compute it. Overall, the RFI sample variance was smaller for non-linear methods (NN, SVR, and GAM) compared with the linear model (MLR). The regression methods did not impact the genetic parameter estimates for RFI, which presented a heritability value around 0.32 ± 0.015 and genetic correlation with FBW ranging between 0.22 ± 0.04 and 0.25 ± 0.04. Prediction accuracy across genomic regression methods was slightly higher (P-value = 0.038) when RFI was computed with SVR (0.336 ± 0.023) compared with the MLR (0.329 ± 0.025), although this small difference would have little practical implications. No differences in terms of ACC were observed among the other regression methods used to compute RFI. Our preliminary results indicate that the regression technique used to compute RFI does not have major implications for this trait. Therefore, the MLR method is the preferred choice as it is simpler to implement, and it provides easy-to-interpret parameters.}",

    abstract = "{Leg disorders (LD) pose serious welfare issues in broiler chickens. The objective of this study was to investigate the suitability of using feeding behavior (FB) traits as potential leg health indicators in floor-raised broilers. The data used were recorded from 95,711 pure-line chickens of both sexes. The individual FB was monitored continuously on a feeder visit basis with a radio-frequency antenna system. The visit-log data were clustered into daily observations for different FB traits and averaged for the 1st week period after the trial started. The FB traits were daily feed intake (DFI1), number of visits (NV1), time spent at the feeder (TSF1), visiting activity interval (VAI1), number of visited feeders (NVF1), and walked distance visiting feeders (WD1). The LD traits were tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), hock-burn (HB), footpad (FP), rotated legs (RO), bowed-in (BI), and bowed-out (BO) leg structure deformities. Multi-trait linear-threshold models were fitted using Bayesian inference for estimating (co)variance components. The heritability (h2) posterior averages and standard deviations (within parentheses) ranged between 0.09 (0.01) and 0.52 (0.03) for LD traits, and between 0.09 (0.01) and 0.47 (0.02) for FB traits. Genetic correlations (rg) between FB and LD traits ranged from null to weak. TD presented negative rg with NV1 (-0.13), TSF1 (-0.14), NVF1 (-0.11), and WD1 (-0.14), indicating that some alleles involved in broiler activity are favorably associated with a potential reduction in the risk of TD-caused bone lesions. Conversely, FP presented unfavorable rg with the same traits (ranging from 0.21 to 0.32), except for TSF1 (-0.08). When compared with the remaining FB traits, DFI1 generally presented the opposite relationships with TD and FP, with positive (0.16) and negative (-0.18) genetic correlations observed for the first and the latter, respectively. Angular and rotational deformities (RO, BI, and BO) did not present significant correlations with FB traits, apart from the weak correlation found between BO and TSF1 (0.11). General activity indicators such as NV1, NVF1, and WD1 could represent earlier selection criteria to reduce TD incidence, although the potential undesired selection response for FP must be further investigated.}",
